# Object_Tracking_Robot

Our objective in this project is to make:

*An object-following robot (built upon Raspberry Pi) designed to track
specific objects in real time. It uses OpenCV, a computer vision tool,
to identify and follow these objects. The robot adjusts its
movements based on the real-time location of the object.*
